This program simulates an operating system's scheduler using 3 different algorithms:
- first come first serve
- shortest job first
- multilevel feedback queue

The program outputs what is currently happening with the scheduler at various time codes. This includes what process
is currently running, what processes are in the ready queue, what processes are in I/O, etc. etc.
